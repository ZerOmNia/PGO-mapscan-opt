1. So do I need multiple accounts in order to use multiple workers?
	-Yes. Put all of them into the usersettings.json file and set them to the same id.
	
2. Should I aim for a 100% scan under 15 minutes? Is that a good way to decide how many workers?
	-Yes for data collecting a time under 15 minutes is good for the first run. subsequent runs will also be faster,
	because of removed empty cells. For hunting/live map purposes 5 minutes would be better as mark.
	
3. For a continuous area larger than -r 30? What is the best, increase the radius and workers or a split in different id's?
	-You want that whole area, don't split. You want parts of it, better split it, i.e. run multiple instances
	of the tool with different ids. Empty areas get removed in subsequent runs, don't worry about those.
	
4. Do the id's still attach on each other or I have to estimate on google maps?
	-They don't attach and in most cases it's better to just use one id anyway.
	If you want them to attach, yes you'll have to use google maps.

5. I just want to set it up efficiently for area XXX and do XXX, but I am unsure for example, how many accounts I would need.
	-See question 3. Scan time decreases linearly with the amount of workers, twice the workers, half the time.
	Also increases quadratically with scan range, twice the range, four times the duration.
	Try it out with some workers and just use a good estimate.
	
6. I have many empty cells, is that bad?
	-Water cells are mostly empty, but even in cities you have some empty cells and in rural areas you have many of them as well.
	They will be removed during the first scan and make subsequent ones faster.
	
7. What is that time format? How can I convert it into something readable?
	-It's the timezone independent unix time, you can easily transform that into any local time format. Example: http://www.unixtimestamp.com/
